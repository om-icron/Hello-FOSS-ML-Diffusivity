# Hello FOSS Diffusivity!

Welcome to our open-source repository where we are building and improving two powerful models: **GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)** and **Stable Diffusion**. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or an AI enthusiast, your contributions and insights are highly valued!

This repository is an open space for collaboration, learning, and building state-of-the-art generative models. We encourage you to explore, experiment, and most importantly, contribute to advancing this project.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)**  
  GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks designed for generating synthetic data that is indistinguishable from real data. They have numerous applications in image generation, super-resolution, and data augmentation.

- **Stable Diffusion**  
  Stable Diffusion is an advanced model capable of generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. It is a state-of-the-art generative model that excels in creating visually stunning images with controllable styles and attributes.
