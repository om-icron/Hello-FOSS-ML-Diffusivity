# GAN_Scratch

Welcome to the **GAN_Scratch** repository! This project contains a GAN model implementation built from scratch, with a focus on hands-on understanding and extensibility.



## Introduction
GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) are a type of neural network used to generate synthetic data that resembles real-world data. This repository is designed for learners and contributors to explore GAN fundamentals by building, training, and experimenting with custom implementations. Currently, the model focuses on image generation and includes a series of improvement and testing issues to tackle.



## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.7+
- CUDA (optional but recommended for GPU support)
  
### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GAN_Scratch.git
   cd GAN_Scratch
