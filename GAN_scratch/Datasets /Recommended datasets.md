# Top Datasets for GAN Training

1. **[CelebA](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)**
   - CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels. This dataset is commonly used for tasks such as face generation and attribute manipulation in GAN models. It is hosted on Kaggle, where users can also access other versions with different resolutions.
   
2. **[Data-Efficient GANs (DiffAugment)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans)**
   - Created by MIT, this repository provides low-shot datasets such as "100-shot Obama" and "100-shot AnimalFace" collections. These datasets work well with the Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment) method, which improves GAN training with minimal data. This is a great resource for low-data scenarios and experimental setups.

3. **[Anime Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset)**
   - This dataset includes thousands of anime character faces, commonly used for generating new anime-style images. It's particularly popular in the GAN community for experimenting with style transfer and cartoon image generation. This dataset is ideal for beginners due to its moderate size and the unique style of the images.

4. **[Fashion MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)**
   - Often referred to as MNIST's sibling for clothes, Fashion MNIST is a dataset of 60,000 grayscale images of fashion items, including shirts, shoes, and bags. It has the same dimensions as MNIST (28x28) and is frequently used as a drop-in replacement for MNIST to benchmark models on a more complex dataset.  
   - Clone with: `git clone git@github.com:zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git`

5. **[CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)**
   - CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images (32x32) across 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. Each class has 6,000 images, providing a balanced dataset for GAN training on diverse object categories. Its small image size makes it well-suited for experimenting with models on a manageable scale.

6. **[Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/)**
   - This dataset includes 37 categories with roughly 200 images per class, totaling 7,349 images of pets. The categories consist of various breeds of cats and dogs, making it a good option for GAN models focused on animal image generation and classification tasks.

7. **[Oxford Flowers 17](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/)**
   - A smaller dataset featuring images of 17 flower species, with 80 images per category. The Oxford Flowers 17 dataset is perfect for simple GAN experiments, image classification, and transfer learning tasks. The limited size and unique flower types make it an excellent dataset for specialized generation tasks.
