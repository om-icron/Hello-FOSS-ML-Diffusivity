# Top Datasets for GAN Training

1. **[CelebA](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset)**
   - CelebA is a large-scale face attributes dataset with over 200,000 celebrity images, each annotated with 40 attribute labels. This dataset is commonly used for tasks such as face generation and attribute manipulation in GAN models. It is hosted on Kaggle, where users can also access other versions with different resolutions.
   
2. **[LSUN (Large-scale Scene Understanding)](https://www.yf.io/p/lsun)**
   - LSUN provides high-quality images categorized into various scene types like bedrooms, churches, and outdoor landscapes, making it ideal for GAN training focused on scene generation. The dataset is large and diverse, containing millions of labeled images that are well-suited for high-resolution image synthesis.
   
3. **[Data-Efficient GANs (DiffAugment)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans)**
   - Created by MIT, this repository provides low-shot datasets such as "100-shot Obama" and "100-shot AnimalFace" collections. These datasets work well with the Differentiable Augmentation (DiffAugment) method, which improves GAN training with minimal data. This is a great resource for low-data scenarios and experimental setups.

4. **[Anime Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset)**
   - This dataset includes thousands of anime character faces, commonly used for generating new anime-style images. It's particularly popular in the GAN community for experimenting with style transfer and cartoon image generation. This dataset is ideal for beginners due to its moderate size and the unique style of the images.
