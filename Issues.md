## Issues for Participants

### 1. Optimize Training Time
   **Description:**  
   The current training loop may not be fully optimized for performance. Your task is to modify the training loop or the GAN architecture to reduce the overall training time without compromising the quality of the generated images. Consider the following optimization techniques:
   - **Batch Size:** Experiment with different batch sizes to find a balance between memory usage and training time.
   - **Learning Rate:** Tuning the learning rate is crucial. Start with smaller values if the model is unstable, or increase if it’s training too slowly.
   - **Model Architecture:** Adjust the number of layers, filter sizes, or even add/remove layers to see how it impacts the GAN's performance. For example, you might try reducing the number of convolutional layers in the discriminator to speed up its forward and backward passes.

   **Expected Outcome:**  
   Participants should aim for a more efficient training loop where the model achieves similar quality outputs in less time. Report the training time and the quality of generated images with each change.

### 2. Implement a Conditional GAN (cGAN)
   **Description:**  
   Modify the current GAN architecture to accept class labels as input and generate class-conditional images. Conditional GANs (cGANs) are useful for generating images of specific classes based on the label provided.
   
   **Steps to Implement:**
   - **Generator Modifications:** Concatenate the class label information with the noise vector (`z`). You might use an embedding layer to transform the class labels before concatenation.
   - **Discriminator Modifications:** Concatenate the class label with the image features or apply the label information to a dedicated branch of the network.
   - **Label Handling:** Since the dataset has 10 classes, ensure that the labels are one-hot encoded and integrated appropriately into the model.
   
   **Expected Outcome:**  
   The modified GAN should be able to generate specific images based on the given label. For example, if you input a label for "5," the generator should create an image resembling the digit "5."

### 3. Experiment with Data Augmentation
   **Description:**  
   Data augmentation can help to introduce more diversity in the training data, which may lead to improved generalization and stability in GAN training. Your task is to experiment with various augmentation techniques on the input data to observe their effects on the generated output.
   
   **Steps to Implement:**
   - **Augmentation Techniques:** Use transformations such as random rotations, horizontal flips, random cropping, color jittering, or Gaussian noise.
   - **Integration:** Apply these transformations to the dataset within the `transforms.Compose()` function or define a custom function to augment data on the fly.
   - **Analyze Results:** Observe how different augmentation methods affect the training stability and the quality of the generated images.
   
   **Expected Outcome:**  
   By introducing augmented data, the GAN should become more robust and potentially produce higher-quality images. Document which transformations work best for this particular GAN model.

### 4. Implement Evaluation Metrics for GANs
   **Description:**  
   GANs are often evaluated using specialized metrics, which measure how realistic or diverse the generated images are. Your task is to implement at least one of the following metrics: 
   
   - **Fréchet Inception Distance (FID):** This metric compares the distributions of real and generated images by passing them through a pre-trained model (such as Inception). The lower the FID score, the closer the generated images are to the real ones.
   - **Inception Score (IS):** This measures the diversity and quality of generated images based on the predictions of a pre-trained classifier.
   
   **Steps to Implement:**
   - **Model Setup:** Use a pre-trained model (e.g., InceptionV3 from `torchvision.models`) to extract features or to make predictions on the generated images.
   - **Calculate Scores:** Implement the metric calculation as a separate function that takes the real and generated images as input and returns the metric score. 
   - **Periodic Evaluation:** Call the evaluation function periodically during training to observe how the score changes over time.
   
   **Expected Outcome:**  
   The evaluation metric(s) should provide a quantitative way to assess the GAN’s performance. Track the metric score across epochs to determine if the model is improving in terms of generating realistic and diverse images.
### 5. Implement Text-to-Image Generation Using the GAN Model

**Description**
Implement a new feature to enable text-to-image generation with the current GAN model. This will involve updating the generator to take text embeddings as input, modifying the data pipeline to include text, and adding a way to evaluate the quality of generated images against their respective textual descriptions.

**Tasks**
1. Research potential ways to incorporate text embeddings into the GAN model (e.g., using pre-trained embeddings or models like BERT or GloVe).
2. Modify the GAN model’s generator to accept and process text data.
3. Implement a data pipeline that includes both images and corresponding text descriptions.
4. Create a function for evaluating the generated images based on the text descriptions.
5. Document the new code and ensure integration with the existing GAN framework.

**Expected Outcome:**
A new feature within the GAN framework that allows users to input textual descriptions and receive generated images based on those descriptions.
